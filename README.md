# React App

[TOC]



### Installation

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12.x and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

If you have yarn installed, install the dependencies using it:

```bash
yarn install
```

or with npm:

```bash
npm install
```



### Usage

```bash
yarn start
```

or with npm:

```bash
npm start
```



#### Establishing connection with the backend server

Initially the app is connected to a backend flask server hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com
).

If you want to wire the backend to the local flask server setup by yourself from the backend code, you may modify the `localhost` value in `host` object to the ip address of the backend flask server.

Check the backend branch in this repo for more information on how to set up flask server.

**./src/backendapi.js**

```javascript
import Axios from 'axios'
const host = {
    heroku: "//pldds-beta.herokuapp.com",
    localhost: "//Your local pldds backend flask server's IP Address or 127.0.0.1:5000(localhost)"
}
export default Axios.create({
    baseURL:host.heroku //change this to localhost
})
```



### Creating production build

To create a production build of this React app, you may run:

```bash
yarn build
```

or with npm:

```bash
npm build
```

You will find the build folder generated in the project directory.



#### Serving the production build

To serve the production build of the app locally, 

Install serve from npm:

```bash
yarn global add serve
```

or

```bash
npm -g i serve
```

and run:

```bash
serve ./build
```
